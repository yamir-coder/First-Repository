# First-Repository

1. Code: shoppinglist.py

I created this code using flet a python library.

It simulates a list app where you can remove and add items to your list.

2. Code: upperlower.py

when I thought flet would be not that entertainment 

I created this random number generator using the range slider

Very useful
