# First-Repository

1. Code: shoppinglist.py

I created this code using flet a python library.

It simulates a list app where you can remove and add items to your list.

I learn how to use more functions and flet and python in general

I created this random number generator using the range slider

Very useful

I learn different ways to organize the code and change the appereance of it.
